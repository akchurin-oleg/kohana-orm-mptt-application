## About MPTT

MPTT - Modified Pre-order Tree Transversal.

The nested set model is a particular technique for representing nested sets
(also known as trees or hierarchies) in relational databases.
The term was apparently introduced by Joe Celko; others describe
the same technique without naming it [1] or using different terms.

For more information - [read wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPTT).
